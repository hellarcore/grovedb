[![GroveDB npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@hellarcore/node-grove.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellarcore/node-grove)

`node-grove` is a GroveDB binding for Node.JS

`node-grove` is [available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellarcore/grovedb)

## Usage

Add the module to your project with `npm install @hellarcore/grovedb`.

## Example

```javascript
const GroveDB = require('@hellarcore/grovedb');

(async function main() {
    const groveDb = new GroveDB('./test.db');

    const tree_key = Buffer.from("test_tree");

    const item_key = Buffer.from("test_key");
    const item_value = Buffer.from("very nice test value");

    const root_tree_path = [];
    const item_tree_path = [tree_key];

    // Making a subtree to insert items into
    await groveDb.insert(
        root_tree_path,
        tree_key,
        { type: "tree", value: Buffer.alloc(32)
        });

    // Inserting an item into the subtree
    await groveDb.insert(
        item_tree_path,
        item_key,
        { type: "item", value: item_value }
    );

    const element = await groveDb.get(item_tree_path, item_key);

    // -> "item"
    console.log(element.type);
    // -> "very nice test value"
    console.log(element.value.toString());

    // Don't forget to close connection when you no longer need it
    await groveDb.close();
})().catch(console.error);
```

## Building and testing

Run `npm run build` to build the package, `npm test` to test it.

## How it works

The main file that is used form the node.js side is `index.js`. It contains
class named `GroveDb`. The actual functions this class makes calls to are
stored in the `./src/lib.rs`. When building the project, it is compiled to
binary in the `prebuilds` directory. This binary imported into the `index.js` file.

Please note that the binding itself contains a lot of code. This is due to
the fact that GroveDB is not thread-safe, and needs to live in its own thread.
It communicates with the main binding thread through messages.
